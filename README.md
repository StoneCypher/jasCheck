# jasCheck

A re-bake of jazmit/jasmine-jscheck to make appropriate for the npm community





## Wait, this is just a compiled [jasmine-jscheck](https://github.com/jazmit/jasmine-jscheck/)

Yeah pretty much.  Also a package, and some other detritus, to get it `npm` available.  Pointing 
at coffeescript gets weird, and I want to be able to make changes, because this is `forAll` and I
might extend that with time.

Jazmit did the hard work.  I just want to make this easier to use in an NPM environment.





# Polemic :neckbeard:

`jasCheck` is MIT licensed, because viral licenses and newspeak language modification are evil.  Free is ***only*** free when it's free for everyone.
